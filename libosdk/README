OSDK- Operating Systems Development Kit
---------------------------------------

you can easily build osdk
just type:
#make clean
#make
this will produce libosdk-i386 library which you can link it easily
to your kernel
just add the following line to your kernel Makefile
ld -e start -Ttext 0x100000 libosdk-i386 kernel.o -o kernel
assuming that kernel.o is your kernel

Notice:
When linking libosdk with your kernel the entry must point to libosdk start function.
libosdk produces multiboot kernel which you can easily boot using grub or any other
boot loader that support multiboot specifications.

After compiling libosdk a sample kernel found in exampleos/ will be compiled for you.
you just copy the file kernel inside exampleos/ to your /boot/ directory and add entry
to grub menu.lst found at /boot/grub/menu.lst as follows:

title kernel
 root (hd0,x)
 kernel /boot/kernel root=/dev/hday

where x = y - 1, y is the partition containing your unix system.
remember grub start counting from zero not 1 as linux does.


For more information about osdk internals and how to use it consult the osdk's wiki:
